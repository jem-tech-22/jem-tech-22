About Me

Hello, I’m Charles James “Jem” T. Salac — a freelance Graphic Designer and Web Developer. I enjoy creating, whether it’s designing visuals, writing code, or learning new skills along the way.

I’m currently a 1st-year college student at ICCT Colleges, Cainta Campus, pursuing my goal of becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Alongside web development and design, I also do graphic design, video editing, and create TikTok content related to arts and technology.

Thank you for visiting!
