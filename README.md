About Me

Hello Users,

I am Charles James "Jem" T. Salac, freelance Graphic Designer, and Web Developer. I really enjoy building this kind of stuff, design here, code there, and learn anywhere.

I'm 1st year college at ICCT Colleges Cainta Campus and aspiring Fullstack Software Engineer. Also, I do graphic designing, video editing, tiktok videos that are related to arts and technology, and such.

Thank you, Users!
